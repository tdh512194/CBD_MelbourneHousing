# CBD_MelbourneHousing
predict a
house&#39;s value. We want to be able to understand what creates value
in a house, as though we were a real estate developer. The project
should follow the guideline as:
1. Examine and explore data (visualization, interactions among
features)
2. Apply the model for prediction with holdout and cross
validation
3. Using PCA, apply the model with holdout and cross
validation
4. Visualize the residue and homoscedasticity
5. Tune the model if necessary
6. Write up analysis for each section (for example, explain why
the model is overfitting, explain why applying PCA is better,
etc.)
7. Include conclusions for summary
